Question1:
Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
Then, the output should be:
again and hello makes perfect practice world

s = input('请输入个英文语句')
s = [x for x in s.split( ) if len(x) > 0]
for i in s:
    while s.count(i)>1:
        s.remove(i)
s.sort(reverse = False)
s = ' '.join(s)
print(s)
